# (Frequency Muter) u/FrequentMuter: a bot that mutes rapid replies in modmail

Since reddit moved fully to reddit chat, some users use modmail as chat.

for example;
Hey  
wil  
be  
short  
fast  
and  
feel  
spammy

This can flood modmail and doesn't give mods time to formulate a reply. This app will help with that by muting users, stopping them from sending more messages. The app will mute users who send X messages in Y seconds, and will give them a Z mute.

You can set X, Y (in seconds) and Z in the settings of the app.

It resets once you've replied in modmail or Y time has passed. Note, the tracker overrules a manual unmute.

Some users type faster then the app can act, so note that at times the app may appear to respond slow.
