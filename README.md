# FrequentMuter: a bot that mutes spam in modmail

since reddit pms were moved to reddit chat, moderators have said that messages

wil  
be  
short,  
fast,  
and  
feel  
spammy

like that. which is why i built this thing. it mutes anyone who (sends `X` messages in `Y` seconds) to receive a `Z` mute.

oh yeah, you need to specify `X` and `Y` in seconds, but a quick google search will help.
